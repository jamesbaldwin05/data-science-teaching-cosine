## Introduction to R for Data Science

**What:** R is a language and environment designed for statistics, data analysis, and visualization.

**Why:** Used by researchers,
analysts, and data scientists, R’s syntax and libraries make it easy to manipulate, model, and visualize data
efficiently—from quick exploration to reproducible research and reports.

**R vs Other languages:**  
R is built for data—vectorized, focused on stats, exploration, and great graphics. Python is general-purpose, using libraries like pandas and NumPy for data work. R’s syntax, especially with the tidyverse and formula interface (y ~ x1 + x2), is simpler and more direct for modeling. R uses 1-based indexing for arrays, matricies, data frames and lists.

**When to use R:**  
- Exploratory data analysis, statistics, quick plotting, reproducible research (R Markdown, Quarto, Shiny)
- Quick, high-quality plots
- Easy, concise data wrangling and visualization

---

## Installing R and RStudio

**What:** RStudio is the most popular IDE for R, providing a user-friendly environment for scripting, plotting, and
reporting.

**Why:** You can also use R from the terminal or via VS Code (with the R extension).

**How:**  
- Download R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- Download RStudio Desktop from [posit.co](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- (Optional) For VS Code, install the [R extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ikuyadeu.r)
- Open RStudio, create a new R script (`.R`), and you’re ready to go!

## CRAN & Installing Packages

**What:** CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) is the central repository for R packages, similar to PyPI for Python.

**Why:** You install packages with `install.packages("pkgname")` and load them with `library(pkgname)`.  
Keep packages up to date with `update.packages()`.

```r
# no-run
# Install and load tidyverse (run once per machine)
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

---

## R Basics & Syntax

**What:** R’s syntax is readable and expressive, with a focus on vectors and data frames.

**Why:** Assignment is usually `<-` but `=` also works. R features data types like vectors, matrices, lists, data frames, and factors (for categorical data). Indexing is 1-based (vs. 0-based in Python). Control structures (if, for, while) are available, but vectorized operations and the apply family are preferred. Functions can return multiple values in a list.

**Comparison:**  
Think of an R data frame as a pandas DataFrame, and R’s vectorization as similar to NumPy arrays.

### Assignment, Basic Types and Basic Output

```r
x <- 10             # numeric
name = "Alice"      # character, note = for assignment also works
passed <- TRUE      # logical (boolean)
nums <- c(1, 2, 3)  # vector

print(name)            # you can also use cat() but this has no newline by default and does not show structure/formatting
"You can print to console by writing between quotations"
5+5                 # will print result to console
```

### Vectors & Vectorized Math

```r
v <- c(2, 4, 6)
result <- v * 2       # result = [4, 8, 12]
sum_v <- sum(v)       # sum_v = 2 + 4 + 6
logical_v <- v > 3  # performs elementwise comparison

print(sum_v)
print(logical_v)
```

### Data Frames

```r
df <- data.frame(name = c("Alice", "Bob"), age = c(20, 22))
df$age[2] <- df$age[2] + 1
str(df)      # structure of df
```

### Indexing & Subsetting

```r
x <- c(10, 20, 30)
x[3]           # access 3nd element (30), R uses 1-based indexing

df <- data.frame(name = c("Alice", "Bob"), age = c(20, 22))
df[1, ]        # first row of df
df$name        # column by name
```

### Control Flow

```r
x <- c(10, 20, 30)

for (val in x) {
  print(val)
}
if (x[1] > 5) {
  print("First element is large")
}
```

### Writing Functions

```r
multiply <- function(a, b = 2) {
  return(a * b)
}
result1 <- multiply(3)
result2 <- multiply(2,4)

result1 # no print needed
result2
```

**You should be able to:**  
- Assign variables and use basic data types
- Perform vector math and logical operations
- Create and modify data frames
- Index and subset vectors and data frames
- Use control flow (if, for)
- Write simple functions with default arguments

## Data Manipulation with tidyverse

**What:** The tidyverse is a collection of packages for modern, fluent data workflows.

**Why:** `dplyr` provides powerful "verbs"
(filter, select, mutate, summarise, group_by). `tidyr` reshapes data. `readr` imports CSVs. `lubridate` works with dates.

**Comparison:**  
dplyr is analogous to pandas (but more readable for chainable operations); tidyr is like pandas’ melt/pivot.

```r
library(tidyverse)

# dplyr verbs
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007, continent != "Oceania") %>%
  select(country, continent, lifeExp, gdpPercap) %>%
  mutate(gdp_bil = gdpPercap * 1e-3) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(med_life = median(lifeExp), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(med_life))

# tidyr reshaping
wide <- tidyr::pivot_wider(gapminder, names_from = continent, values_from = pop, values_fill = 0)
long <- tidyr::pivot_longer(wide, cols = -c(country, year), names_to = "continent", values_to = "pop")

# Handling missing data
df <- tibble(x = c(NA, 2, 3))
df %>% mutate(x2 = if_else(is.na(x), 0, x))
```

**You should be able to:**  
- Use dplyr verbs for filtering, transforming, summarizing
- Reshape data with tidyr
- Import data with readr, handle dates with lubridate

---

## Data Visualization

**What:** `ggplot2` implements the grammar of graphics for layered, customizable plots.

**Why:** Create scatter, bar, histogram, box,
and time-series plots. Themes, color, and facets enable publication-ready graphics.

**Comparison:**  
ggplot2 is to R what seaborn (or matplotlib) is to Python, but with a more consistent, layered grammar.

```r
library(ggplot2)

# Scatter with color/facet
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~ year) +
  labs(title = "Life Expectancy vs. GDP per Capita")

# Histogram and boxplot
ggplot(gapminder, aes(lifeExp)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "skyblue") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(gapminder, aes(continent, lifeExp, fill = continent)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_classic()

# Time series
library(lubridate)
gapminder %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(mean_le = mean(lifeExp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, mean_le)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Global Mean Life Expectancy")
```

**You should be able to:**  
- Create basic and advanced plots
- Customize plots with color, theme, and facets

---

## Working with Real Data

**What:** R makes it easy to load, clean, and explore real datasets.

**Why:** Use `gapminder` (install with `install.packages("gapminder")`)
or `nycflights13` for practical examples. Handle missing data, rename columns, and do quick EDA.

```r
library(gapminder)
data(gapminder)

# Basic exploration
head(gapminder)
summary(gapminder)
str(gapminder)

# Clean: remove missing, rename
clean <- gapminder %>%
  filter(!is.na(lifeExp)) %>%
  rename(country_name = country)

# Quick EDA: count by continent
table(clean$continent)
```

**You should be able to:**  
- Import and inspect real datasets
- Clean data and handle missing values

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**What:** EDA helps you understand the structure and relationships in your data.

**Why:** Use summary stats, distribution plots,
and correlation matrices. Visual EDA guides further analysis and modeling decisions.

```r
# Summary stats and correlation
summary(gapminder)
cor(gapminder$lifeExp, gapminder$gdpPercap)

# Distribution plots
library(GGally)
ggpairs(gapminder[, c("lifeExp", "gdpPercap", "pop")])

# Visual EDA tip: color by group
ggplot(gapminder, aes(lifeExp, fill = continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4)
```

**You should be able to:**  
- Compute summary statistics
- Visualize distributions and relationships

---

## Basic Statistics

**What:** R includes built-in functions for descriptive stats, t-tests, chi-squared, ANOVA, and regression.

**Why:** Use the
`broom` package to tidy model outputs into data frames.

```r
# Descriptive stats
mean(gapminder$lifeExp)
sd(gapminder$lifeExp)

# t-test
t.test(lifeExp ~ continent, data = gapminder, subset = continent %in% c("Europe", "Asia"))

# ANOVA
aov_res <- aov(lifeExp ~ continent, data = gapminder)
summary(aov_res)

# Linear regression with tidy output
library(broom)
model <- lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap + continent, data = gapminder)
tidy(model)
```

**You should be able to:**  
- Run common statistical tests
- Fit and interpret simple regression models

---

## Introduction to Modeling

**What:** The `tidymodels` or `caret` packages provide unified APIs for machine learning.

**Why:** Split data, train models,
evaluate with metrics. Try linear/logistic regression or decision trees.

```r
library(tidymodels)

set.seed(42)
split <- initial_split(gapminder, prop = 0.7)
train <- training(split)
test <- testing(split)

# Linear regression
lm_mod <- linear_reg() %>%
  fit(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap + continent, data = train)

pred <- predict(lm_mod, test)
results <- bind_cols(test, pred)
yardstick::rmse(results, truth = lifeExp, estimate = .pred)
```

**You should be able to:**  
- Split data, fit and evaluate simple models

---

## R Markdown & Reporting

**What:** R Markdown lets you combine code, output, and narrative in a single document—great for reports, research,
and sharing results.

**Why:** Knit to HTML, PDF, or Word from within RStudio.

- Start a new `.Rmd` file in RStudio, add code chunks with ```{r} ... ```
- Render with the "Knit" button
- Embed plots, tables, and narrative text

---

## Best Practices & Ecosystem

**What:** Write idiomatic, well-commented code. Organize projects with RStudio Projects for reproducibility.

**Why:** Use Git for version control (RStudio has built-in support). Find packages on CRAN or GitHub; check
documentation and vignettes. Share work with RMarkdown, Shiny, or Quarto.

- Clean code: consistent naming, comments, avoid side-effects
- Use `.Rproj` files and `here::here()` for file paths
- Version control: [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/)
- Community: RStudio Community, Stack Overflow, R-Ladies
